		<h3>Where My Writing Started</h3>
			<p>In my eyes, writing is not just a creative passion, but a <em>professional skill</em>. My earliest works were stories: adventures to be reenacted in childhood play, explorations of growth and identity, poetic excerpts to manifest emotions... Yet as I've received exposure to a plethora of professional and academic experiences, my eyes have opened to the importance of written clarity, concision, and detail in content beyond the storybook. And each variety or type of content has its own story to tell.</p>
			<p>There is crucial value in the writing and editing efforts that go into works such as business proposals, team project documentation, and instruction manuals read by everyday people; as well as the communication and collaborative efforts that make such projects possible. Writing with global awareness, attention to accessibility, and an awareness of purpose and audience are critical to helping them succeed. That is why I, with my technological prowess, creative know-how, and service-oriented skills, aim to work in Professional & Technical Writing (PTW) - so that functional products, innovative services, and relationships between businesses and their clients have the structure to succeed.</p>

		<h3>My Career Goal</h3>
			<p>With the values and skillsets described above, my career goal is to enter the PTW industry as a Technical Writer. According to the <cite>Society for Technical Communication</cite>,</p>
				<p><blockquote>“Technical communication involves the delivery of clear, consistent, and factual information—often stemming from complex concepts—for safe and efficient use and effective comprehension by users. Technical communication is a user-centered approach for providing the right information, in the right way, at the right time so that the user’s life is more productive. The value that technical communicators deliver is twofold: <em>They make information more usable and accessible to those who need that information,</em> and <em>they advance the goals of the companies and organizations that employ them.</em>”</blockquote></p>
			<p>As a Technical Writer, I would have the wherewithal to utilize my writing as an intermediary between businesses and their clients/customers. The clarity and perspective I would bring to my employers would both further their business goals and satisfy the needs of clients, such as technicians or user testers, that utilize the information I provide.</p>
