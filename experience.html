				<p>In this piece, I was challenged to consider and describe my relationship with editing, both as a process and a facet of writing. I took a personal approach that was less focused on parts of the editing process, and more focused on how my thoughts/feelings about editing have changed over the course of my life.</p>

				<p>This document is a proposal I designed with a team as build-up to my Final Project for ENGH 388. We wanted to create a concise yet visually memorable document that communicated all the information we needed to share with our theoretical client. There was lots of emphasis on document design, clarity of information, and accessibility as we put it together.</p>
